QnQ is a community credentials app that works like Lulu for insular communities. It allows users to find out how they're connected to one another over social media. Current connections features use the facebook graph search to show mutual friends and mutual groups. Users are also able to flag one another as a way of either vouching for or warning against individuals as community members. User profiles can provide a reference point for users in making decisions about building their social circles and communities.

Intended upcoming features include events mutually attended, blogs mutually followed, and other points of intersection that can speak to mutual group belonging.
